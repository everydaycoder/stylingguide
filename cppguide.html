    <h1>C++ Styling Guide</h1>
    <p>C++ is a language that is very powerful, and therefore, in some cases, superior. This power comes in the form of pointers, raw assembly instructions, memory management, you name it. But these also aren't necessarily the prettiest things to look at when implemented in code.</p>
    <p>Code that involves these kinds of things becomes hard to manage and maintain, and so nobody can get any work done at the end of the day. Since all of the documentation and code our developers write get shared with others, this is a big problem. So what we did is come up with a set of guidelines you should follow in order to make your code as readable as possible.</p>
    <p>This document also is meant to be something you have to study for days on end in order to perfect. We've compacted it into such a small size, that you could learn almost everything there is to know here in a few hours, if not less than an hour. This is a result of the strive to make the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/">Google Style Guides</a> easier to abide by, since these documents sometimes take even a few weeks to perfect.</p>
